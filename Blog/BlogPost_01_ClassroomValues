##Collective Respect 


In the context of an immersive, all-day-and-most-of-the-night education experience, there's nothing more vital to group and individual success than a classroom atmosphere of collective respect. 

We're gonna be in each other's company for 12 preposterously grueling weeks, so in the interest of   everyone's nerve endings, we should consider the following to be baseline  behaviors:

*	Show up on time. (Better yet, try to get to class 15 minutes early, leaving yourself a cushion in case you miss your train, lose your keys, or experience spontaneous unconciousness for no reason at all.) That way, we can get to the day's work when we're meant to.
 
*	Help your fellow students when they need it. Heck, try to help out your instructors when you're able. These days are long.

*	Don't judge. We're all coming from different places and different skill levels, so don't compound those differences with judgement. 

*	Take care of the space. It's not a trashcan, and it's obviously not a concert venue, so clean up after yourself and maintain an unquestionably legitimate volume. We need to hear ourselves free think.

__Actionable idea:__ Weekly check-ins/calibrations to make sure our environment suits our needs rather than thwarts them.


##Free Think

Brilliant ideas are never conceived fully formed, so let's adopt the position of giving every idea a chance, even if only for a moment; Remember, it only takes a spark to start a wildfire. 

__Actionable idea:__ Every idea--and I do mean every--get's a post-it note.

##Fun

Listen:

We'll find unimagined reserves of energy if we keep things fun. 

We'll learn more, faster, if we keep things fun.

We'll amaze ourselves if we keep things fun. 

We'll have fun if we keep things fun.

So let's keep things fun. 

__Actionable Idea__: Keep up the already-brewing tradition of giving students and instructors the chance to tell a joke or story during breaks in instruction. Or if someone knows of a meme/YouTube video/gif that's bound to go viral, let's encourage "Awesomeness Sharing." The internet is incredible, so let's not forget to let it breathe from time to time.
