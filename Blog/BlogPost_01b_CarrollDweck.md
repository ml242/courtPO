##Effort == "Growth"
The thing that most struck me about Carroll Dweck's lecture was the insight that Americans see intellectual difficulty as a reflection of stupidity. 

Honestly, I'd never given it much thought, but it's true. We often seek out tasks and activities that we can easily do without thumping our egos, and often shun things that take sustained effort.

Because of the difficulty and volume of what we're learning, we as a class need to reframe the concept of effort. Here's one articulation:

Effort isn't inversely related to intelligence. Rather, our intelligence and understanding will grow proportionately to our effort.

__Actionable idea:__ Institute mental check-ins when you are struggling with a concept, and remind yourself that you're not struggling so much as learning something difficult and therefore worthwhile. Don't get discouraged. You're getting better all the time.

##Acknowledge Your Miraculousness
This class is going to test our intellectual and emotional limits. Acknowledge it, and know that you've encountered challenges before and overcome them. Know that you'll do great.

__Actionable idea:__ Write a self-addressed letter being completely honest with yourself about the difficulties you're about to encounter, and remind yourself of difficulties you've faced and overcome in the past. So often we forget how much we've accomplished in our lives, things that we never thought possible, so put it all down on paper so you can come back to this letter as a psychological anchor in times of crisis.

##Ego Suicide
Let go of your idea of yourself. It's likely 'fixed' on some level, and therefore holding you back on that level. Let it go.

__Actionable idea:__ Practice choiceless awareness meditation over lunch. Let your ego soften and break apart... 

Or if that's too hippy-dippy for you, just go to the bathroom, look yourself in the mirror, and repeat "I am #{your_full_name}" 100 times until you longer know who you are.
