### Question 1

My values:  
- Creativity   
- Passion  
- Sense of Community  

I believe that these three values encompass my idea of a successful WDI student. Creativity will help you find and develop and interesting and exciting path to be on. Passion will help you go an extra mile and bulldoze your way through the hardships. Community will be there to help you get up and keep going when you're down and it's hard for you to get up.   
The only thing you can possibly do that will make these values stick with you and others is to lead by example. Live what you preach and show others it can be done. Displaying creativity, passion and sense of community will inspire others to raise to that level, and to those who can not, you will need to extend your hand.

### Question 2  

The growth minset is very powerful. It can help people get through tough times and grow from the struggle. One thing that is possible to do is to ask people briefly about their recent strugle. Let them know that it's ok to go through something like that and that they're not the only ones. Let them explain how they were able to overcome the strugle and what triggered the solution; this might help you in your future with a similar problem where this talk inspires the solution for you. The entire kick-hash family can do this everyday with each other to help people succeed.
