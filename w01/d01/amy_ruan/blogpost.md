#Passion / Support / Free-think

These traits will foster an environment conducive to learning and growth. If individuals are passionate and supportive, everyone will work hard and help their teammmates reach their potential. If a community promotes free-thinking, then individuals and team will be open to sharing divergent and interesting opinions/ideas. 

When the learning curve steepens, I have to remind myself to the reasons why I decided to leave my comfort zone and embark on this journey. I will organize my notes on a weekly basis and provide it to any family member who might want to share/view it for references. I will also try to encourage fellow family members to do the same. 

#Embrace and learn from your failures or mistakes. 

The most important takeaway in the "growth-mindset" is to embrace and learn from your mistakes or failures. "Potential" is not measured by the initial efforts or failed attempts. It is measured by your willingness to go after challenges that will help you grow. I've been stuck in the "fixed mindset" for a very long time professionally and academically. I feared failures and avoided most things that I was not understand. I am still in progress with my conversion! 

In order to help foster an environment that is open to embracing failures, I have to make sure I have an optimistic and open attitude. If I need help, I need to get over myself and ask more questions. I have to also take time to be aware of my fellow family members progress and help them if I am capable of it!
