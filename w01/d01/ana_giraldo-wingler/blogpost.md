# Important Community Values
---
- Take care of yourself
- Don't compete and encourage sharing
- Creativity

I put "taking care of yourself" first because it is the item that is most difficult for me. When I get excited about a project, or stressed out about one, among the first things to slip are my health and hygiene. But it's one of the most basic things a person can do to ensure the proper functioning of their system. In the same way a car needs maintenance, your body does, too—and neglecting it is only going to lower your performance (and possibly cause a crash!) A good way to make sure Team Kick-Hash is upholding these might be to implement a streamlined system of daily hygiene checks.

Competition, for me, is poison. I will be cruising along happily on a project until I notice that someone is trying to do better than me, at which point I freeze up and stop. I think this is something I have to work on, but nonetheless, competition is something I absolutely avoid in a work environment. Different people feel differently on this point, but at least in a learning setting, a friendly, we're-all-helping-each-other environment is better than an I-want-you-to-fail one. A good way to implement this within Team Kick-Hash might be to make sure we're helping at least one other person every day.

When I chose "creativity," I was thinking not so much of *having* it as of encouraging it. Some companies—especially older ones—are very stuck in their ways and not only neglect, but shun, innovation. This is bad. To avoid stagnation, I have a Google Doc labeled "Ideas" that I open at least once a day either to elaborate on a previous idea, or jot a new one down.



# Growth Mindset
---
- Effort as the path to growth
- Hug yourself
- Give someone else a hug

The biggest thing I took from watching Carol Dweck's talk was the idea that our society views effort as weakness. This is true, and I noticed that I thought this way, too, when after college I embarked on a charity cycling trip across the country. For the first few days, I don't think I have ever wanted to quit something so badly in my life. This isn't because I didn't want to do it, but because I was so embarrassed of how much effort it would take me to succeed. I didn't want my other teammates to see me struggling. It took me about two weeks of isolating myself from the group and riding alone before I realized that it was actually easier to get through the day by opening up to others about how much I was struggling. A good way to implement viewing effort as a path to growth in Team Kick-Hash might be to open up to others about what we're struggling with—to let go of any shame associated with trying hard.

The phrase "hug yourself" is the strongest, most effective tool in my self-encouragement arsenal. At least once every thirty minutes, I find myself thinking a self-deprecating thought. It might be, "I wore the wrong shoes today," or "Maybe I'm just fooling myself into thinking I can do this." I have a lot of experience with negative self-talk, and the thing that I've found works best for me is to either give myself a physical hug or, if in public, just think of doing so. A fixed mindset is inherently negative, so I'm pretty sure my phrase would work in the context of Team Kick-Hash in combatting shame in effort.

Sometimes, though, people are hesitant to give themselves a hug. Maybe they're just hell-bent on beating themselves up—on just throwing in the towel. This is when it's time to encourage someone else. Give them a hug. Most of the time, it'll make you feel good, too.
