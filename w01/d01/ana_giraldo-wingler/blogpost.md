# Important Community Values
---
- Take care of yourself
- Don't compete and encourage sharing
- Creativity

I put "taking care of yourself" first because it is the item that is most difficult for me. When I get excited about a project, or stressed out about one, among the first things to slip are my health and hygiene. But it's one of the most basic things a person can do to ensure the proper functioning of their system. In the same way a car needs maintenance, your body does, tooâ€”and neglecting it is only going to lower your performance (and possibly cause a crash!)



# Growth Mindset
---
Effort as the path to growth
Hug yourself
Give someone else a hug
Write yourself a letter
