# Important Community Values

- Take care of yourself
- Don't compete and encourage sharing
- Creativity

I put "taking care of yourself" first because it is the item that is most difficult for me. When I get excited about a project, or stressed out about one, among the first things to slip are my health and hygiene. But it's one of the most basic things a person can do to ensure the proper functioning of their system. In the same way a car needs maintenance, your body does, too—and neglecting it is only going to lower your performance (and possibly cause a crash!) A good way to make sure Team Kick-Hash is upholding these might be to implement a streamlined system of daily hygiene checks.

Competition, for me, is poison. I will be cruising along happily on a project until I notice that someone is trying to do better than me, at which point I freeze up and stop. I think this is something I have to work on, but nonetheless, competition is something I absolutely avoid in a work environment. Different people feel differently on this point, but at least in a learning setting, a friendly, we're-all-helping-each-other environment is better than an I-want-you-to-fail one. A good way to implement this within Team Kick-Hash might be to make sure we're helping at least one other person every day.

When I chose "creativity," I was thinking not so much of *having* it as of encouraging it. Some companies—especially older ones—are very stuck in their ways and not only neglect, but shun, innovation. This is bad. To avoid stagnation, I have a Google Doc labeled "Ideas" that I open at least once a day either to elaborate on a previous idea, or jot a new one down.



# Growth Mindset

The biggest thing I took from watching Carol Dweck's talk was the idea that our society views effort as weakness. 

Effort as the path to growth
Hug yourself
Give someone else a hug
Write yourself a letter
