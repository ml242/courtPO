#Question 1

###Choose 3 values from the board 

* Embrace Faliure
* Embrace Iteration 
* Passion

1 . *Why are they important to you?*

I really believe in the idea of **embracing faliure** as a key element in the learning proccess. Education systems all across the globe teach us the opposite: to fail is a bad thing. Faliure is only a bad thing when we don't try enought. That takes us to the second value: **embracing iteration**. By doing it we are adopting a growth mindset and implicitly accepting the fact that inteligence is DYNAMIC. We can get smarter. And getting smarter is a byproduct of **being passionate** about learning something we like.  

2 . *What specific actionable items can you do to uphold these values?*

- Ask questions when I don't understand
- Learn by doing and sharing 

3 . *What specific action items can you do to help others in our kick-hash community to uphold these values?*

- Share what we know
- Share the need for help when we don't know something
