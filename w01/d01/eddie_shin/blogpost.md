Although all of these values are extremely important, I feel that the three that stand out are Passion, Teamwork and Fun. I think most of us (if not all of us) are here because we are passionate about coding and web development, but it is important for us not to be discouraged and lose momentum. To keep our passion going, we should encourage one another, which is a great lead into the next value, teamwork. This is by no means an easy task and as a group we should all encourage one another and support eachother. Fun may be overlooked as an attribute but it is imperative that we are able to enjoy what we do and learn. 

Having a growth mindset, specifically outlined by Caroll Dwek is key to having a successful experience AT WDI. I think in order to achieve and maintain a growth mindset, everyone, especially myself, need to accept the fact that we will struggle with a lot of the work and we will need to rely on the help of others. Vulnerability is key for having a growth mindset.
