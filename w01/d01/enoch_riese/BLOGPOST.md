One value that is very important to me is __comraderie, accountability, and mentorship__. It's important to me to be in an environment where I don't feel like I have to learn everything myself or be secretive with my discoveries. We can all work so much faster when everyone is sharing and everyone can trust one another. Especially within open source, accountability can be difficult to monitor, but as a class/family, I think that we can be really good about crediting one another and sharing ownership of results toward which we have all worked. Some action items I can do to help others in our kick-hash community uphold these values include gently helping out and encouraging when I see that someone is stuck, making sure to always note that others have helped me, and making sure that people feel comfortable coming to me for help with anything that I might be particularly good at.

Another value I really like is __take care of yourself__. We've already encountered some frustrations in this process, and we're bound to encounter even more, and if we're not each making sure that we're taking the breaks we need, getting the rest we need, feeding ourselves the way we need to be fed, etc. it's likely that our frustrations with the code will become frustrations with one another. For me, this is particularly actionable in terms of making sure that I'm aware of my general mood when I speak to people. If I'm not paying attention, I can become frustrated with people through no fault of their own. I am not very good at getting the rest I need or feeding myself properly, so I can also pay extra attention to those aspects of self care during this process. Most importantly, though, I can be kind to myself about my mistakes and encourage others to be similarly kind with themselves.

My third value is __be friendly__. I like this one better than friendship because not everyone is going to be friends, but everyone can make the effort to be warm and inviting, and there's nothing worse than being in a program that takes up most of your time and energy and feel totally isolated while you do it; that's a huge drain. I can uphold this by making sure to reach out to people who are alone during lunch or project time. I can help others uphold this value by encouraging everyone to sit in a new spot every day so that we experience learning next to everyone.
