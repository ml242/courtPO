###Regarding Class Values
Three values I would like to talk about are  

1. **Passion**
2. **Support** and **Inspiration**
3. **Coffee**, **Beer**, and **Food**

Why is **passion** important? Simply put, it is what makes us interesting human beings. Without passion, there is no life. Passion makes everything we do more enjoyable. Passion is what will make what we create in life substantial.

I will ensure that Kickhash has passion by demonstrating my own. Lead by example.

I can measure my level of passion by continually making sure I am blogging everything I learn, as sharing is something that is very important to me.

Furthermore, I will strive to challenge myself. Without challenge, my passion runs dry. If I get bored, things become very not interesting, very quick. If what I am working on is too easy, I will supplimement my workload with things that do not come to me easily.

**Support** and **Inspiration** are crucial to a learning environment. **Support** is what keeps us going when the times get tough. We must be our own **support**, as well as, thriving on when it is given to us by others. 

**Support** is something that not everyone will give out willingly. Some people live to help others.
