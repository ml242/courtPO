###Regarding Values
Three values I would like to discuss are  

1. **Passion**
2. **Support** and **Inspiration**
3. **Coffee**, **Beer**, and **Food**

Why is **passion** important? Simply put, it is what makes us interesting human beings. Without passion, there is no life. Passion makes everything we do more enjoyable. Passion is what will make what we create in life substantial.

I will ensure the flow of passion by demonstrating my own. Lead by example.

I can measure my level of passion by continually making sure I am blogging everything I learn, as sharing is something that is very important to me.

Furthermore, I will strive to challenge myself. Without challenge, my passion runs dry. If I get bored, things become very not interesting, very quick. If what I am working on is too easy, I will supplimement my workload with things that do not come to me easily.

**Support** and **Inspiration** are crucial to a learning environment. **Support** is what keeps us going when the times get tough. We must be our own **support**, as well as, thriving on when it is given to us by others. 

**Support** is something that not everyone will give out willingly. Embrace it and share it.

**Inspiration** is a truly important in life. Everyone needs a role-model. Doesn't have to be a person. Your source of **inspiration** can be a book, an album, or even your computer. Just make sure to keep looking and don't settle unless you are positive it is the real thing.

Lastly, I want to touch on **Coffee**, **Beer**, and **Food**. These are some ridiculously vital things in life. 

**Coffee**, or tea, or whatever you like to drink that enhances your cerebral flow will ensure a good start to the day. Sometimes I can fit in an awesome yoga session and skip the caffeine. But, not every day allows for such a priviledge.

You have to eat **food** or you will wither away. Might as well be **passionate** about what you eat, and what you drink for that matter. No two foods, or drinks, are equal. Each has its own unique characteristics, benefits, and even downsides. Hopefully the pros outweigh the cons. Use some common sense on this one.

**Beer** is great.

I have some strong feelings on **beer** so I will devote an entire post, or two or three, to it in the future. Thank god for **beer**.
