The 3 values from the board I choose:

- Collective Respect
- Don't Compete
- Take Care of yourself

##Why are they important to you?
They are important because we are all a team; The more our team can grow, the more we can grow as individuals. As we help each other, we can be as strong as the support around us. __"Collective Respect"__ is important for the group as a whole, __"Don't Compete"__ is important for each individual within the group in order to be the most collaborative, and __"Take Care of Yourself"__ is important for each individual to best to approach their learning in order to reach their goals, without overstressing themselves.


##What specific actionable items can you do to uphold these values?
Offer support! My optimism towards others is one of my strengths and I hope that my positive attitude can effect the mood the class. I would also be happy to help others who are struggling if I figure it out early. And in terms of taking care of myself, make sure I have plenty of rest, plenty of coffee, and allow myself to de-stress once class is over and I've finished assignments. 

##What specific action items can you do to help others in our kick-hash community to uphold these values?
Free hugs! I'll listen to anyone who needs an ear and hug anyone who needs a hug. I also enjoy proof reading resumes (for some reason!) so if anyone needs that I could offer to help. I enjoy planning events as well so I wouldn't mind planning a night for all of us to hang out and continue to develop a sense of community and friendship.
