#Question 1:
---

The three values that are most important to me throughout the 12 weeks (and beyond) of WDI are learning, support, and fun. To me, learning is an extremely important value because that is what I am here to do: learn.  I am here to learn a new set of skills that will open up a whole new world of endless opportunities. Each day we come in to learn which is why it is such a vital value.  Next, and just as important, is support.  Support is something that everyone will need at some point throughout this learning experience.  Building a strong support system within our family is necessary to make sure we all reach our individual and group goals, and we need to make sure we all hold each other accountable to support one another through every challenge.  Finally, fun.  I can already tell this is going to be an intense, overwhelming and stressful experience, with ups and downs everyday so it's important to remember to have fun.  If not, we're all going to go crazy.  We need to make this a fun experience in any way we can.

---The specific actionable items that I can do to uphold these values is to make sure that I arrive each day with a positive mindset, ready to learn.  I know I will have to depend on my classmates for help, so I need to make sure that I make myself available to help them as well.  That support system that we can build in our class will help us all along the way.  I also can make sure that I don’t get too hard on myself and keep it a fun atmosphere so it is an enjoyable place to learn.
---To help others in the kick-hash community uphold these values, I need to first make sure I am upholding these values and remember that we all need to work together as a team and hold each other accountable.  I think it is important that none of us is left behind, so we can all move forward and learn together.
---#Question 2:
---With regards to Carol Dweck, something that is particularly important to me is to constantly work on “developing yourself.”  In her discussion about perfectionism, I learned that perfection does not have to be your goal, but you should constantly strive for high standards, continuously trying to improve and develop yourself.  My number one goal with WDI is to learn something new.  When you struggle and feel overwhelmed, that is when you are learning.
---To make sure the kick-hash community has this mindset, it is important to focus on learning something new each day, even if it seems impossible, because that is when we are truly learning something.  We need to be responsible for ourselves, and make sure that we are continuously getting better.
---To ensure that I have this mindset, I need to realize that this is not going to come easy, but when I am faced with a difficult problem or stressful situation, I need to remind myself that if I stay positive I will get through it and learn a priceless new skill set.
