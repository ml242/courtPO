# Friendship / Support / Community / Fun / Love

I think that too often, these values are so underplayed. I just had dinner with the the co-founder of [Socratic](http://socratic.org/) (what I was doing when I stepped out at 8pm) and we were both talking about how important this is for educational experiances—in face I believe that it is really important in any kind of human experiance. Life's too short *not* to have this.

This adventure is going to be really difficult for not just you guys, but me as well. I am up right now writing this with you guys! But it's going to so worthwhile, not just because of how gratifying it is to be able to teach other people things, but from all the things that I will be learning from you as well both directly and indirectly!

Directly, I'll be learning about pupetry of the Japanese variety or about the really awesome organization Code Now. Indirectly, I'm learning about how to become a better teacher and there's certainly *lots* of room to grow there and with your support, friendship, love, and feedback, I will be able to get there.

Also, the the gratifiation towards the worthwhile end is not just from teaching, but being able to *live* in this kind of community. Finding communities like these are far and few between, that's why it's so important to craft communities like these. Let's keep it up guys!

Together, we will achieve great things!

### Actionable Items
- Enable people to organize community events!

# Communicate

As was said so eloquently in class, "If you don't communicate, there is not communication"—or something like that anyway. There's no way for us to learn without this communication, no way for us to share, support each other. Friendships won't really be real and a community would not exist. It is so important that we communicate with each other transparently (which I think I am OK at) and clearly (something that I am very much still working on!)

### Actionale Items
- Speak slowly and think clearly. Just slow down in general

# Mindset
Like a bunch of you guys that I have talked to have told me about yourselves, I myself certainly am coming from a fixed perfectionist mindset. I have actively tried to combat this attitutde for a long time now and it is a long and hard problem. I think towards teaching, I have a growth mindset and you guys are already reminding us of that—which is awesome!

### Actionable Items
- I will make sure to keep talking with many of my friends who know that one of my main objectives here is to get better at teaching at teaching making my students the top priority. And if things don't go well—that's ok, because they'll give feedback and I will get better!
