## Three Values

I've decided to choose *passion*, *free think* and *fun* as the three values from the board that I want to write about. Each word represents part of a mentality dedicated to enhancing yourself. Passion provides the fuel to persevere through seemingly unsurmountable challenges; free think allows you to open your thoughts beyond what you currently understand; and having fun allows you to enjoy the journey for more than just what you tangibly achieve along the way.

I think that the very best way to make sure that I'm upholding my values is to write. I write a good amount in my spare time, because it helps me to reflect on what's occurred in the recent past, as well as plan for the future. In that same vein, I plan to keep a journal of my experience at WDI and to regularly update it. 

I imagine that the best way I can help others is by simply supporting and respecting them. That means helping others on small tasks if I can do so, as well as encouraging their progress.

## Carol Dweck

In our group discussion we mentioned that our biggest take-aways from the Carol Dweck reading and video were.

- Perfection is a falsehood
- Acknowledge the positive values that exist in the challenges and setbacks you face
- Become a part of changing society's fixed into a growth mindset

Professor Dweck's teachings are particularly important in our setting at WDI because we know that we're going to go through many difficult and challenging situations. Remembering to think with a growth mindset will help us to gain as much as possible from the course, and whatever else we continue with in the future. 

Very much like the values mentioned above, the best way for me to ensure that I maintain a growth mindset is to introspectively reflect. If I continue telling myself the values that Professor Dweck outlined, I will reinforce the growth mindset in myself. 

In order to help the Kick Hash Community to maintain a growth mindset I will not only verbally express the ideas of growth mindset, but I also plan to lead by example. I believe that words and actions are equally as powerful, and that different people respond to each in different ways, which is why I find it important to ensure that I am consistent with my emphasis on growth mindset.
