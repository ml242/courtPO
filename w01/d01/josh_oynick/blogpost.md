##Pregunta the Firsto

###__3 Values:__ 
1. Respect
2. Take Care of Yourself
3. Creativity

These three are very important to me, especially as it pertains to this class. Respect (showing up on time, being on task, helping others around me) will be beneficial to me and others in the class. Taking care of myself (exercise, sleep, real food!) will give me the energy I need to keep my brain fresh and natural endorphins to conquer Himalayan code like a veteran sherpa. Creativity is the key to keeping assignments fun and interesting, and coming up with projects that are memorable, inspiring, and most of all fun to work on.

All three of these values affect one another and can work in tandem to create a great experience in the course. Upholding them will be a consistent, daily effort, including being early and having done the work, exercising regularly and getting enough sleep, and in terms of creativity, not being afraid of throwing ideas out there - there is no wrong answer and saying an idea out loud means giving others the opportunity to build on it and collaborate to create things that individually wouldn't have happened. 

Every day, I should be cognizant of those around me and push them in a positive way to uphold these values - in this way building relationships and opening up myself to being reminded of them when I inevitably need a colleague to do so.

##Pregunta the Segundo

Learning about the growth mindset has been an excellent way to prepare for the rigors of this course, and focusing on maintaining it will be key to my success in the course. One important thing we discussed is that effort is a good thing - do not be afraid when things get difficult, but embrace the challenge. When you get stuck on something, don't view it as a failure from which there can be no improvement, but an opportunity to stretch my abilities and knowledge. 

Specific, actionable items for the community is a constant is vocally encouraging one another and identifying when someone is frustrated and helping talk through it and troubleshoot. For myself, I will be rereading the first chapter this weekend to further engrain it and recharge my mindset after an already intense and exciting first week - perhaps regular rereadings and reminders will help refresh the growth mindset as we progress through the course.
