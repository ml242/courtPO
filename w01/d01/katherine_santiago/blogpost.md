After our first day of class, I think we all know we're in for a long 12 weeks of hard work. WDI is no joke. We're going to be walking, talking, thinking, eating, drinking and sleeping this stuff. So it's really important that as we push our minds and our physical selves that we take care to continue to boost our drive as well. Creating a fun, supportive, encouraging and non-judgmental environment is the key to doing this. 

It's simple for me. I know that I am part of this new family that has to work together and work through issues together to find success. Staying after class tonight plodding through homework with other Kick-Hash members confirmed that. Not only did it make the situation bearable, but the students who stayed were able to support and encourage each other, and were able to work through hiccups together, where a lone student may have felt lost and frustrated. Creating situations where small groups not only learn from the instructors but from each other helps manage stress, and continuing to foster this culture is important as the work will certainly become harder from here. 

Here's to the challenge.
