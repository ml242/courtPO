1. Support 
2. Be friendly
3. learning.

Everything on the list is great. Everything about having a growth mindeset is great and important, too. Sometimes higher concepts of learning can obfuscate obvious aspects about being a great teammate. These three things sum it up. If everyone is friendly to the point where they can help pick up a struggling classmate, we'll all learn. I wholeheartedly believe that teaching is the only way to truly understand a subject, hearing a lecture will take most people a long time to get anything. So I fail to see what else this list is missing. If we're supportive, and everyone is friendly and learning, we're all going to be best friends. It's going to be a ton of fun. We're going to make projects that kickhash, too. And then we can get really passionate about this coding stuff!

The Dweck lecture is important. Coming from an extremely liberal arts background, improving on challenging things and admitting what you don't know is the only way to grow. I think that as we strengthen our weaknesses, it can only help up acheive more and even find inspiration in more and more unlikely places. No one walking the earth has ever been perfect, although that's especially true when you start something. I don't know everything. But I do know that nobody knew everything when they started either, so I'm at no disadvantage. The important thing is to embrace the struggle, because it is through the effort in which you can learn and grow. And as our brains get ever rewired to think in new ways, the growth mindset can only accelerrate our humble improvement.
