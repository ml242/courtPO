###1. A dose of PCP will do the trick..

__Passion__ - You have to enjoy what you are doing, or there is no point in continuing. Life is too short to waste time on something that does not give pleasure.  For most people, their work takes up about one-third of their entire existence, and that's at least half of their waking or conscious life, so you have to have a passion for what you do to be happy.  Otherwise, you will end up going through the motions and everyday will seem like a copy of the previous.  Passion for your craft can also lead to greater focus and attention. If you love what you do everyday, then you will take challenge as  an opportunity, instead of a problem to solve.

__Community__ - Community can be your fellow students giving you encouragement or an online forum that has every answer to your questions.  I believe people have an innate sense to help, even if all they receive in return is imaginary website points or a thank you from someone they will never meet.  If we wanted to learn programming alone, we would of stayed at home.  It's going to be difficult to stay focused and not feel burned out, and many of us will temporarily loose sight of our goals, but if there is a support system in place that can give positive feedback, then it will make it much easier for everyone to follow through as a team. We better get along, after all, we will be together for 12 "years"!

__Persistence__ - If you have passion and community support, then it will be a lot easier to find the drive to succeed.  In the grand scheme, 12 weeks is not that long of a period.  However, anyone can, and probably will get lost in time, and those that can continue course in spite of difficulty can make it with persistence.

###2. Carolyn Dweck - Growth Mindset Takeaway
#####Genius can be learned  
Genetics play a role in intelligence, but a healthy environment can also create a space much more adept to learning and can significantly help how one adapts to everyday life.  If a child is in a positive environment and encouraged to try new things, new neural pathways and connections will be made forming habits that can last.  Not all people learn at the same rate, but if they are given the seeds, water, and a positive culture, then most anyone can succeed.

#####Go against the flow
Often children that are quick learners are praised for how smart they are giving them a sense of privilege.  They don't want to give up their rite or entitlement, so they may avoid activities that may challenge their false sense of superiority.  As they grow older, they are not conditioned for hardship and don't know how to act when faced with difficulty.  Those that did face adversity in childhood learned to hustle, which gives them life skills and preparation to succeed.  

These ideas are important because they don't just apply to children, and it doesn't allow one to sit back and be complacent.  It helps one stand up and make the decisions to forge their own way.  They learn to take small incremental steps that, at times, may not be in the best direction, but the experience gives a change of perception, and allows the expansion of the capacity to learn new thing and make new neural connections.

As a Kickhasher, I vow to give others and myself positive reinforcement, and contribute to a growth mindset environment.  Also, when I journey through Mordor, I will not turn and run when Rails rears its ugly rear, I will find my Backbone and ask, "Who is Sinatra and whom does he work for?"
