##Question 1 #


Three values that are important to me:

- Passion
- Teamwork
- Respect



To me, these values are more than important; I don't see a way that this class could function without them. Without passion there is no point in pursuing anything. No motivation to succeed, no motivation to push on when you fail. Without teamwork you have only your own skills to rely onâ€¦ and if that were enough, none of us would be in this course! Without respect you can have no team. You can't have a free flow of ideas or a community that encourages questioning and support, since nobody can be comfortable enough to be truly open. 

I can take the following actionable steps to uphold these values: 

__Passion__

- Set goals for myself
- Ask others what their goals are and help remind them when they struggle


__Teamwork__

- Offer my help to others
- Ask for help when I need it
- Be candid about my mistakes so others feel comfortable talking about theirs and asking for help
- Be nice!

__Respect__

- Keep negative opinions quiet
- Do not judge

##Question 2 #

My team agreed that the most important things were to not be hard on yourself, to maintaing a growth mindset, and to get rid of your ego and the notion that a lack of struggle is somehow admirable. These are all important because they define how you deal with difficulties in learning and can determine how you grow from difficult experiences. 

We can do the following things to ensure our community maintains a growth mindset:

- Individually write down past instances in which we have encountered a really difficult task that we thought we were bad at, have persisted at and at which we have eventually succeeded. 
- Change our language, saying things like "good effort" and moving away from things like "you're so smart" or "this is easy for you" or even "good job."
- Get rid of our egos! Get over ourselves! It's okay to be bad at things!

As for myself, I truly believe that I already have a growth mindset. I'm good yo.
