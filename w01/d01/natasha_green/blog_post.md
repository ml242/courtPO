Questions 1

The three values that are important to me are passion, respect, and taking care of yourself.  They are important because with passion you can overcome any obstacles you hit; with respect at all levels people will respect what you are about and what you want to do; lastly, taking care of yourself allow you to focus on the task at hand because you are healthy to do so. 

To uphold each one of these values for:
Passion, I can be enthusiastic about what I am going to do
Respect, by not taking other people for granted and value my time also
Taking care of myself, working out will be the best thing for me

A specific thing I do to help others uphold the value I enjoy is to invite people to work out with me. 

Question 2:

What is important to me is the idea that we are continually learners and this helps us to reach the level that we want to reach in no matte what area or field we are passionate about.  To make sure the that our community has the mindset I can just tell people to remember what they are passionate about and keep that in mind when they feel it is hard. In order for me to get that done I will also tell myself remember you end goal.
