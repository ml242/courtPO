Three Important Values

- Passion
- Learning
- Fun

I believe these are three of the most important values to achieving success during WDI. As all of the students in WDI have made significant sacrafices to participate in the course it is evident that we all have a passion for learning web development. Over the next 12 weeks we can work together to ensure that passion does not waiver as we move through the course. The homeworks and projects will serve as important benchmarks in our learning process and hopefully we will schedule plenty of fun activities along the way. 


In my group discussion about Caroll Dwek we thought it is important to push ourselves to complete assignments to the best of our ability and push ourselves to find new and better ways to solve the same problems. Specifically if we write a function or some other code we should then assess the code for weaknesses and then refactor that code to make it cleaner, more efficient and possibly even faster. The effort to improve our own code by trying to find weakness in our own work will ensure we are always striving to maximize our growth during WDI.
