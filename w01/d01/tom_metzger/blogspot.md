# Question 1

Choose 3 values from the board you put together below (photos below)

- Why are they important to you?
- What specific actionable items can you do to uphold these values?
- What specific action items can you do to help others in our kick-hash community to uphold these values?

The three values that are most important to me are __Respect__,  __Support and Inspire Each Other__, and __Share and Embrace Iteration__.

I am here to learn as much as I can about full stack development as I can in 12 weeks but not just learnâ€¦ to absorb and internalize this information and this mindset of problem solving & createion.  The timeline for the program is  very short, and I'm sure many people are taking risks and have made sacrifices to be here.  This is why __Respect__ is the first value that I list.  

To me this means respect everyone's time, their right to learn & ask questions, but also their right to not have the class held up by someone who didn't do the work.  This mutual respect is very important to me.  We also need to respect each other enough to give truthful feedback in a constructive manner and respect each individual's personal growth struggle that they will face during the course.  We need to help each other, __Encourage__ each other, __Support__ each other during this program, and __Inspire__ each other to put in the extra effort to wring every last bit of learning out of this class that we can.

We are in this together and we will learn more and learn faster if we are open and __Share__ along the way.  Share successes & failures and don't be embarassed about either.  Fail early, fail often is a tech mantra as I understand it but the value lies in understanding why something failed and learning from that experience.  __Embracing Iteration__ is not something most people need or have the opportunity to do in normal life but I believe it is a crucial part of our education and evolution and it will only be strengthened if we respect each other enough to honestly and constructively share our opinions about projects, code, and many other aspects of this course during out time in the program.


###Action items for fostering these values
#####Respect:
Keep to set timelines.
- 5 minutes means 5 minutes.  Starting at 1pm means in our seats at 12:58 so that we're ready to start at 1pm.
