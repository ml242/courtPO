#Response 1

The three values that are most important to me are __Respect__,  __Support and Inspire Each Other__, and __Share and Embrace Iteration__.

I am here to learn as much as I can about full stack development as I can in 12 weeks but not just learn… to absorb and internalize this information and this mindset of problem solving & createion.  The timeline for the program is  very short, and I'm sure many people are taking risks and have made sacrifices to be here.  This is why __Respect__ is the first value that I list.  

To me this means respect everyone's time, their right to learn & ask questions, but also their right to not have the class held up by someone who didn't do the work.  This mutual respect is very important to me.  We also need to respect each other enough to give truthful feedback in a constructive manner and respect each individual's personal growth struggle that they will face during the course.  We need to help each other, __Encourage__ each other, __Support__ each other during this program, and __Inspire__ each other to put in the extra effort to wring every last bit of learning out of this class that we can.

We are in this together and we will learn more and learn faster if we are open and __Share__ along the way.  Share successes & failures and don't be embarassed about either.  Failure is not a bad F-word.  Fail early, fail often is a tech mantra as I understand it but the value lies in understanding why something failed and learning from that experience.  __Embracing Iteration__ is not something most people need or have the opportunity to do in normal life but I believe it is a crucial part of our education and evolution and it will only be strengthened if we respect each other enough to honestly and constructively share our opinions about projects, code, and many other aspects of this course during out time in the program.


###Action items for fostering these values
#####Respect:
Keep to set timelines:

- 5 minutes means 5 minutes and starting at 1pm means in our seats at 12:58pm so that we're ready to start at 1

Everyone does the work:

- we should take advantage of office hours to keep up when we're having trouble with difficult assignments or as dedicated time to makeup missed assignments 

Understand that different people learn at different rates with different concepts

- take advantage of this to help each other -- identify when you get something and volunteer to help anyone who might have questions
- provide help with encouragement and positive reinforcement
- raise your hand and ask for help when you need it

# Question 2

Think about what you talked about from your discussion of Caroll Dwek in your group that was particularly important to you.

- Why are these important.
- What are specific actionable items that you can do to ensure our kick hash community has this mindset?
- What specific actionable items can you do to help yourself have this mindset?

---
#Response 2

#####Important mindset concepts

- Struggle is good
- Eliminate duck syndrome
- Identify opportunities for growth

It is important to spend time struggling with difficult concepts to learn how to solve problems and develop creative workarounds while becoming comfortable with this discomfort of creativity.

Duck syndrome–appearing calm while furiously working–will not foster this environment of embracing struggle, creative solutioning, and success.

Acknowledging our strenghts and weaknesses so that we can identify classmates with complementary skills that can help us in the areas where we struggle most will accelerate our learning and growth.

#####Action items 

Get to know my classmates better and share my experiences, strengths, and weaknesses in an attempt to foster this environment.  Communicate when I need help and when I think I can provide help.  Work hard and collaborate to struggle through challenging tasks as a group be it in person on on HipChat.
