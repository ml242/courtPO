# Question 1

Choose 3 values from the board you put together below (photos below)

##Passion | Support | Fun

- Why are they important to you?
<br>
__You have to be passionate about your work. I recall college courses where so many students were just hour-watching, waiting for class to end, while those who were passionate about what they were learning were active in class and engaged. 
<br>
<br>
Support is invaluable. Flying solo as we did on the pre-work shows that you can try to figure this stuff out on your own, but a good support system is like driving in the fastlane. That's what we have and need to maintain here. 
<br>
<br>
At the end of the day, did I have fun? The answer, no matter how tired/frustrated/lost I am, should be that the journey was fun.__
<br>

- What specific actionable items can you do to uphold these values?
<br>
__Remind myself every day why I'm here and why I'm doing this. If I ever lose my passion, I'll remember that there is an end result as a product of all this hard work. I can look back on my goals I set for the course if I ever lose passion.
<br>
<br>
To maintain a collective support system, I need to continue to engage with the work as much as possible. This involves utilizing the extra resources provided by the instructors, visiting office hours, and making myself a resource to the class if I have a handle on the material where others do not.
<br>
<br>
I should try to make myself and at least one other person in class smile once during the day. I'll try to get a well-timed .gif or video or other link in HipChat at some point. This is serious stuff and humor is necessary. Fun is required for sanity.__
<br>

- What specific action items can you do to help others in our kick-hash community to uphold these values? 
<br>
__Always be energetic, even when I'm frustrated. I'm sure these 12 weeks will run the gammut of emotions, but there is no worse emotion to display than apathy or lethargy.
<br>
<br>
I can always make myself a resource and make it known that I am available for questions or anything.
<br>
<br>
Be fun.__

# Question 2

Think about what you talked about from your discussion of Caroll Dwek in your group that was particularly important to you.

- Why are these important.

__The growth mindset is essential in learning these challenging concepts. Hitting roadblocks is inevitable. "Why do we fall, Bruce?â€¦so that we can learn to pick ourselvs up"__

- What are specific actionable items that you can do to ensure our kick hash community has this mindset?

__Speak up when things are moving too fast. Affirm that these concepts are hard.__

- What specific actionable items can you do to help yourself have this mindset?

__Stay focused and engaged. Do not ever say "oh, I'll learn this later."__
