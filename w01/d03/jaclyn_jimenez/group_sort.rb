# program asks for size of group
# students are randomly choosen from list and sorted into arrays = # of groups
# students are associated with funny team name group
# if there is a remaining student, put in last group

# laterâ€¦
# - try incorperating this hash information making the students into hashes to add additional information about them, here is the link that you can use. [Here is the CSV file](http://f.cl.ly/items/06370G222n1u122o2q1W/class.txt).
# - incorperate using conditionals based
# - try adding emails
# - try using feature branches for each of these
# - refactor your codes to use more methods as a craftsperson
# - try optimizing
