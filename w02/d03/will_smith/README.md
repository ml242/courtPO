# HW has 3 Parts

1. Finish the eCardly excercise [more details below].
2. Finish the Beer Excercise with the Sinatra Routes.
	- [Instructions](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_NYC_Hash/blob/master/week_02/d03/morning_excercises.md)
	- If you weren't completely comfortable on the idea of objects, certainly review this excercise and do it again from scratch. [Here is the work that I uploaded](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_NYC_Hash/tree/master/week_02/d03/distillery) by try to look at it as little as possible.
3. Optional but Highly Recomended: Watch this amazing serious on HTML & CSS. That's how Jonathan really started understanding CSS (he had to watch it twice).
	- [Videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL697D36B35F92E9E4): I would say watch videos 1-6 over the course of this week. This series means business, it is made by Google employees *for* google employees.
