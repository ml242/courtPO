similar routing to:

get "/" do
  url = "http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/Quote/json?symbol=goog"
  response = HTTParty.get(url)
  data_hash = response["Data"]
  last_price = data_hash["LastPrice"]
  name = data_hash["Name"]
  "#{name} is currently at the last price #{last_price}"
end

get "/:stock_symbol" do
  stock_symbol = params[:stock_symbol]
  url = "http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/Quote/json?symbol=#{stock_symbol}"
  response = HTTParty.get(url)
  data_hash = response["Data"]
  last_price = data_hash["LastPrice"]
  name = data_hash["Name"]
  "#{name} is currently at the last price #{last_price}"

Main Page Google Style Form,

Enter Movie title
(make a rollover for title, year, actor, whatever)

results page is movies/search which should display title and year | in another column show the poster with a google link

Make title a route to our own local movies/:imdbID

response = HTTParty.get "http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=True%20Grit"

link = #{search[:IMDBid]}
<&= <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/#{link}">title</a> %>
