## Refactor

Make your movies app use a database!

Create a database called `movies_db`

Create a `movies.sql` file that creates a movies table

The movies table should include all the attributes you display in your movies show page.

Add a `save` button to your movie's show page.

When a user clicks `save` send a `post` request back to your server that saves your movie to your database.

Hint use a hidden field to send back the movie's imdb rating.

Add a `faves` link to your movies index page.

When a user clicks `faves` display all the movies saved to your database.
