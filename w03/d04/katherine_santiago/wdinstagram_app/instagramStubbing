get /photos/new

# when a user goes, here they get a form to create a new photo
  - has a post method
  - and an action = "/photos"

  -

post /photos

  this will be called when a user submits a form (which is from /photos/new)

  The values of the form will be accessible from the params that are
    - Author = params["author"]
    - Photo = params["photo"]
    - Date Taken = params["date_taken"]
  I need to take each value in the params
  And then construct a new ActiveRecord Object for an Entry

user1 = User.create({name: 'Phil', age: 30})

Entry.create({ author: "#{author}",
  photo: "#{photo}",
  date_taken: "#{date_taken}" })

  And then save it to the database
  Then I need to redirect to GET /entries

get '/photos/:id'

  this will be called when a user clicks on a specific photo entry from '/photos' page
  It will display: all information about the photo
  - Author
  - Photo
  - Date Taken

  This will also have a link that allows people to go back to the page listing all the photos
