## Objectives
* Use Sinatra & ActiveRecord to build a single model CRUD app
* Start building apps following the MVC paradigm

## Prompt
Our one model here is going to be an Entry. An Entry has the following:

* Author
* Photo (url)
* Date Taken

Your Sinatara app should have the following controller actions:

* Index (Displays all entries)
* New (Displays a form to create a new entry)
* Create (Creates a new entry and saves it to the database)
* Show (Displays one particular entry)

## Instructions

1. Start by setting up your database using SQL:
  * Plan your schema
  * Create your database
  * Test your database using psql

2. Set up your model using ActiveRecord
  * Test your ActiveRecord class using pry (as with "active_record.rb" during class)

3. Set up your controller & views
  * Tackle the actions one at a time!

4. Update your views and add styling to make it look nice!
