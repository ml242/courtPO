#Time
I'll be done with all the user stories by tuesday night **EXCEPT** the social network stuff which may take me all/most of wednesday.

I'll spend thursday afternoon adding a featureâ€¦ either a new page with a graphical rep of the structure of the story so far or a system of nested senence submition. thursday night i'll make sure it looks real pretty.
