I want to build a rockclimbing app. There are many different user cases to this project but I would like to scope it out so I can build the leaf.

i am a user
  i want to signup
so i can view the site

I am a registered climber
  seeking routes
so i can climb

i am a climber
  saving routes
so i can compare my ability

i am a photgrapher
  shooting routes
so i can share pictures

I am a registered user
  I want to view
all my saved climbs

I am a climber
  seeking friends
so i have company

i am a climber
  seeking a location
so i'm not lost
