# Homework

##### Watch User Authentication

1. Download and watch the [NEW railscast authentication episode](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49019009/250-authentication-from-scratch-revised.mp4) (it uses the new authentication paradigm that PHil talked about). If you watched the other video, go back and use this one.
	- [Here are the show notes.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49019009/Authentication%20from%20Scratch%20%28revised%29%20-%20RailsCasts.html)
2. Try to implement this on your own from scratch.

##### Project Guidelines

Read through the [project guidelines](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_NYC_Hash/blob/master/week_05/project/project_guidelines.md) *very carefully* and follow the directions for tonight. There are many more detailed instructions on this page for what needs to be complete on monday.
