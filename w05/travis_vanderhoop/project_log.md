Hi Alicia!


##Tuesday, October 22nd

What happened yesterday (Monday, October 21)?

+	I wrote out my user stories, drew all my wireframes, and discussed the MVP with my standup team.
+	I got my data models set up and authentication working.


Which user stories are to be completed today?

+	With the completion of the 'New Entry Form,' I will provide users the ability to log, categorize, and persist their thoughts to the database for later review. 
+	I will also let users edit their previous entries using a form ultra-similar to the create form.

	
Any obstacles/blocks for today's stories?

+	I need to wake up early and learn about nested forms. Particularly the 'accepts_nested_attributes_for' method, so that I can create an entry as I simulateneously create nested 'ideas.'
