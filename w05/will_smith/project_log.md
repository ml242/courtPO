# Watch.it Project Log #
This will be a repository of issues from the day. User stories and wireframes are in my notebook. 
***
## Monday ##
* Need to verify that my tables are configured properly. Have them set up in the app, but **need** to make sure they're correct. 
* Have resources generated, but did a lot of nesting. After figuring out the issue above, I need to make sure my routes are correctly configured. 
***
## Tuesday ##
* Tables and relationships configured properly. Search configured properly with omdbapi
* Absolutely lost on how to move forward with saving movies to the database based on my current user flow. 
* Stubbed out sudo code for where I think things should go. Need help moving forward with how to specifically save things to the database and where things need to be displayed.
