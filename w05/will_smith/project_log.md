This will be a repository of issues from the day. User stories and wireframes are in my notebook.

## Monday ##
* Need to verify that my tables are configured properly. Have them set up in the app, but **need** to make sure they're correct. 
* Have resources generated, but did a lot of nesting. After figuring out the issue above, I need to make sure my routes are correctly configured.
