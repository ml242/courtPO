# Watch.it Project Log #
This will be a repository of issues from the day. User stories and wireframes are in my notebook. 
***
## Monday ##
* Need to verify that my tables are configured properly. Have them set up in the app, but **need** to make sure they're correct. 
* Have resources generated, but did a lot of nesting. After figuring out the issue above, I need to make sure my routes are correctly configured. 
***
## Tuesday ##
* Tables and relationships configured properly. Search configured properly with omdbapi
* Absolutely lost on how to move forward with saving movies to the database based on my current user flow. 
* Stubbed out sudo code for where I think things should go. Need help moving forward with how to specifically save things to the database and where things need to be displayed. 

***
## Wednesday ##
* Challenging time today trying to figure out how to make my table relationships work properly, but they do and I have a product that actually does something. 
* Still need to add CSS styling and try to impliment reviews if time tomorrow. 
* Having issues deploying to Heroku. Will debug tomorrow. 
***
## Thursday ##
* Issues with conflicting bootstrap frameworks. Had to figure out how to completely remove one so that things weren't being overridden. 
* Had bugs with displaying images when on heroku. Struggled with the disparity between having things work locally for me and having them not work on heroku
* Had serious CSS issues with layout and responsiveness. Didn't have any sort of plan going in and basically designed each page by feel. As a result, the CSS doesn't make a lot of sense and there's really no order to my naming conventions or structure to the CSS file. 
* Spent most of the night refactoring my UX and first user experience. Having the javascript plugin for the homepage was helpful for telling a story. 
* Got a life-saving hack from Jonathan that got my images working.

## Friday ###
### Post Mortem ###
* Planning out the scope of my project was the easy part. User stories and user flow conceptually makes sense to me and I can plan out a user flow pretty easily. 
* The struggles come when I don't have anything to reference. There are pieces of code in my app that I still am struggling to reproduce and explain where and why it's happening. 
* Assigning time value to my planning items and user stories is going to be the biggest challenge going forward. I need to figure out what to do when I can't move forward unless I get something to work. 
* Mostly, my code is a mess. There are mixed conventions and bad practice all over the place.
* Building into my plan should be the checklist of items I need to make to impliment a feature.
