Week 6 Day 2 HW
============
- **MTA.js**
    - Create a simple subway system
    - **Functionality**
      - Prompt the user for all of these arguments:
          - starting line
          - starting station
          - ending line
          - ending station
      - Finally, bring up an alert that states the number of stops needed to make the trip
    - **Objects**
        - Define a `Line` Constructor
            - A line object's name and stops should be stored within this object
        - Define an Constructor called `SubwaySystem`
            - All the lines should be stored within this object
            - All the of prompts should also take place here
    - **Lines**
        - The N line has the following stops:
            - Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th
        - The L line has the following stops:
            - 8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st
        - The 6 line has the following stops:
            - Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place.
        - All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square, but there are no other intersection points.

        #### Hints:

        * Get the program to work for a single line before trying to tackle multiple lines.
        * Don't worry about user input. Start off by just hardcoding your stop and line choices in local variables.
        * Remember, you've done this in Ruby before. Look at your code and figure out how to do it in JavaScript.
