# Cinder: Tinder for Cats!

## Task
---

- How would you model tinder for cats in a rails application?
- What does the model look like?
- How about the routes?
- [Checkout this drawing again for restful routing conventions](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1N_4JClUYDpK7NcxWHi4ydadtFASEWNm-vQVRRSFHmkI/edit?usp=drive_web)

(If you were given these specifications, you should be able to build the application without any questions.)


## When you finish:
---
- Then find a partner who also recently finished (or ask one of us to help you find a partner)
- Compare your notes on your specifications with your partner (make sure it is a different partner from yesterday)
- Then come find one of us to check against what you guys made
- Then setup a git project to build the basic crud app component (no voting required).
	- Have one person create the rails appliation and then have the same person create the github repository.
	- Figure out who is going to do which part of the crud app, and then GO!
	- If you guy's get stuck, google, and if you still can't find it after 5 minutes, raise your hands! You will have forgotten things! You can also glance  at one of your old projects or check in today's ASSIGNMENT_FILES/0_plain_old_crud_app for help!
